  title: Order
  description: An order is used to define the material to be produced, plant location where production has to be done, date and time of production, and quantity of goods required. It also defines which components and sequence of operations are to be used and how the order costs are to be settled. This API can be called to perform order related actions such as find and release orders, retrieve order list, and update custom values for given order.
