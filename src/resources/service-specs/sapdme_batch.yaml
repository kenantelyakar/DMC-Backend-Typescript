      summary: Creates a batch number for a given plant and material.
      description: There are synchronous and asynchronous types of batch creation. The type of batch creation used is determined by the numbering configuration (in the Manage Next Numbers app) for batch number. If the Source is "ERP", batch number is created in ERP system and synchronously transferred to SAP Digital Manufacturing. If the Source is "Local", batch number is firstly created in SAP Digital Manufacturing and then synchronized to ERP system.
