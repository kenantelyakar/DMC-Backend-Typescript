      description: 'With this endpoint call, a logistics order is updated to Accepted status or Ready for Pick status by specific processor or an integrated third-party transport system. Only this processor or relative third-party transport system can further execute the logistics order. Depending on the reference type of the logistics order, the status is updated as follows: If the reference type is packing unit, the status is updated to Accepted when the packing unit is still open, and to Ready for Pick when the packing unit is already closed. If the reference type is shop floor control (SFC), the status is updated to Ready for Pick when the operation is completed on the source location, and to Accepted status in all the other cases. If the reference type is carrier, the status is updated to Ready for Pick.'
